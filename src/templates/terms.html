            <p style="text-align: left;">By uploading or entering any material into our website, you assert that it does not contain:</p>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>Content that you do not have the intellectual property rights to 
            use, due to copyright, trademark, patent or other protection. Your local
            jurisdiction may allow you to use protected content under fair use 
            provisions, provided you do not share it with others.</li>
            <li>Content designed to subvert the correct functioning of software or hardware, such as viruses and code exploits.</li>
            <li>Content that is illegal in the United States, the European Union or your country of residence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: left;">If you are an intellectual property holder 
            and believe your rights have been violated, please see the "Intellectual
            Property Violations" section below.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">If you share your material publicly, you must also ensure:</p>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>It does not contain content that might offend others, such as pornography, hate speech or libel.</li>
            <li>It does not attempt to modify or replace the function, content or branding of our website.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Sharing Decks</h2>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;">Sharing</h3>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>You may optionally share a deck you have uploaded, making it available for others to download from AnkiCollab.</li>
            <li>When you share a deck, you grant us a worldwide, royalty-free, 
            non-exclusive license to make the deck available to users under the 
            Shared Deck License below.</li>
            <li>You further grant us the right to modify the deck you shared, 
            including but not limited to creating excerpts, and converting to new 
            file formats.</li>
            <li>You may elect to remove the shared deck from our servers at any 
            time. This will stop us from providing the deck for download. We do not 
            store records of who has downloaded a certain deck, so we can not 
            retroactively remove a deck from users who have already downloaded it. 
            Due to caching, there may be a delay between when you ask for a removal of a 
            deck and when it becomes unavailable to others.</li>
            <li>When you share a deck, you will be required to assert that it is 
            entirely your own work, or that you have obtained a license from the 
            intellectual property holder to share the material here. If we suspect 
            that material has been uploaded in violation of intellectual property 
            rights, we will remove it from the shared deck list, and may remove your
            ability to share decks in the future.</li>
            <li>While we do not have the resources to manually check decks that are 
            uploaded to our website, we reserve the right to remove any we come 
            across that we deem inappropriate, including but not limited to ones 
            with poor quality descriptions or content, and ones that are only useful
            to a small group of people (such as lecture notes for a specific 
            class).</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;">Shared Deck License</h3>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>When you download a deck that someone has shared, the deck author 
            grants you a permanent, non-revocable, worldwide, royalty free, 
            non-exclusive license to use the material in your personal studies.</li>
            <li>This license is for personal use only, and the deck may not be 
            redistributed, re-uploaded, published, or used for any other purposes 
            without explicit permission from the copyright holder.</li>
            <li>Shared decks have been provided by third parties and are not reviewed by us, so we can offer no warranty or support for them.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 style="text-align: left;">Intellectual Property Violations</h3>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Each time users share a deck, they're 
            required to confirm that the content is entirely their own work, or that
            they have obtained a license from the intellectual property holder. If 
            you believe someone has violated your intellectual property rights, 
            please email <a href="mailto:ankicollab@proton.me">ankicollab@proton.me</a> 
            to let us know. Please provide us with a link to the offending content, 
            and a link to your site, book or other original content that the 
            material has been taken from. If you are writing on behalf of another, 
            you must have the authority to act on their behalf. Please be advised 
            that if you make a false report, you may place yourself open to legal 
            action.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Access to the Service</h2>
            <ul style="text-align: left;">
            <li>You may access AnkiCollab directly through your browser, and through the sync functionality incorporated into the Anki add-on</li>
            <li>Because other clients can cause problems, AnkiCollab does not currently
            allow access from browser extensions or other third-party clients.</li>
            <li>We reserve the right to suspend or remove your access to the service at our sole discretion.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Violations &amp; Law Enforcement</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">If you fail to comply with these terms of 
            service, we may suspend or remove your account at our sole discretion. 
            If your actions were illegal, we may also report you to the authorities.
            We will provide your information to third parties when required to do 
            so by law.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Changes</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">If we make significant changes to these 
            terms, we will notify you via a message on the website, a message when 
            you sync, or via an email.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Transfer</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">In the event of a company acquisition, 
            restructure, or bankruptcy, we may transfer these rights and obligations
            to the new legal entity.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Use of the service is at your own risk. 
            While we endeavor to ensure the integrity of your data, ultimately the 
            responsibility is in your hands. Please keep a local backup of your data
            for safety's sake.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED "AS IS". WHEN 
            ALLOWED BY LOCAL LAW, WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, 
            EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE WARRANTIES OF

            WE MAKE NO WARRANTY THAT THE SERVICE WILL BE ERROR FREE OR THAT ACCESS 
            WILL BE CONTINUOUS OR UNINTERRUPTED. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT USE OF THE 
            SERVICE IS ENTIRELY AT YOUR DISCRETION AND RISK.</p>
            <h2 style="text-align: left;">Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p style="text-align: left;">TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO 
            EVENT SHALL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, 
            INCIDENTAL OR OTHER DAMAGES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, LOSS OF 
            DATA, INCORRECT DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER DAMAGES OR 
            LOSSES INCURRED BY YOUR USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE THIS SERVICE, EVEN 
            IF WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, AND 
            REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY.</p>
